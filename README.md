## audev.kennzahlenupdate

### Functionality

This repo builds the foundation for the daily Kennzahlenupdate report. 
It consists of two parts:

* import
* forecast

The _import_ part takes care of importing all necessary data from various 
sources. The _forecast_ part takes care of the monthly forecast generated from the IVW 
data. Both parts share common code, however they are treated as seperate applications 
to keep the flexibility of executing them standalone.
